What is this?
====================================================================
This R package performs transfinite cardinal arithmetic.  Finite 
cardinals are also supported.



How do I install it?
====================================================================
To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley Wickham's
devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After installing that,
you can enter

library(devtools)
install_github(username="wrathematics", repo="tfca")

into an R terminal to install this package.  See the manual and demos
for an explanation of usage.
